Use for Linux(Fedora)
=====================

Fedora is a nice Linux distribution developed by the community-supported Fedora Project 
and Sponsored by Red Hat. Here I will list some contents of Fedora when I using it.

Repository
-----------
We use ``DNF`` as a tool to manage the RPM packages and download software from 
repository, such as ``fedora.repo``, ``fedora-update.repo``. However, official
repositories are slowly downloaded for us at home, we need to use Domestic mirrors
instead. The third part mirrors are in the following.

- 163:
.. code:: shell
   
    wget http://mirrors.163.com/.help/fedora-163.repo
    wget http://mirrors.163.com/.help/fedora-updates-163.repo

- aliyun
.. code:: shell

    wget http://mirrors.aliyun.com/repo/fedora.repo
    wget http://mirrors.aliyun.com/repo/fedora-updates.repo

There are some useful mirrors in the mean while

- `FZUG <https://github.com/FZUG/repo/wiki/%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0-FZUG-%E6%BA%90>`_

    a Fedora software repo of Chinese community.

- `RPMfusion <https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration/>`_

We can choose the fastest mirror by setting ``fastestmirror=true`` in 
``/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`` after Fedora 22. the installation is as following

.. code:: shell

    dnf clean all
    download *.repo in /etc/yum.repos.d/
    dnf makecache
