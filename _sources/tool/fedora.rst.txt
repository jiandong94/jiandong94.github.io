Use for Linux(Fedora)
=====================

Fedora is a nice Linux distribution developed by the community-supported Fedora Project 
and Sponsored by Red Hat. Here I will list some contents of Fedora when I using it.

Installation
-------------
Win10+Fedora with 2 drives: 250GB SSD and 500GB HDD.

After Win10 installed, there are 125GB SSD and 233GB HDD left. I want to install 
root(/), swap, boot, boot-efi on SSD and install home(/home) on HDD. I have to creat two Volumn Group 
to make sure the root(/) and home(/home) are mounted at two partitions.  

There may be a bug that the maximum boot size for ``ext4`` file system is 1024KB, but the minimum size for 
installation is 200MB. I choose ``EFI System Partition`` instead and set 1024MB size, then reselect ``ext4``.
The problem seems to be solved but I don't know why.

Repository
-----------
We use ``DNF`` as a tool to manage the RPM packages and download software from 
repository, such as ``fedora.repo``, ``fedora-update.repo``. However, official
repositories are slowly downloaded for us at home, we need to use Domestic mirrors
instead. The third part mirrors are in the following.

- 163:

.. code:: shell
   
    wget http://mirrors.163.com/.help/fedora-163.repo
    wget http://mirrors.163.com/.help/fedora-updates-163.repo

- aliyun

.. code:: shell

    wget http://mirrors.aliyun.com/repo/fedora.repo
    wget http://mirrors.aliyun.com/repo/fedora-updates.repo

There are some useful mirrors in the mean while

- `FZUG <https://github.com/FZUG/repo/wiki/%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0-FZUG-%E6%BA%90>`_

    a Fedora software repo of Chinese community.

- `RPMfusion <https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration/>`_

We can choose the fastest mirror by setting ``fastestmirror=true`` in 
``/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`` after Fedora 22. the installation is as following

.. code:: shell

    dnf clean all
    download *.repo in /etc/yum.repos.d/
    dnf makecache

Systemd
---------
systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. 
It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and 
starts the rest of the system.

.. code:: shell

    [Unit]
    Description=Name of Service
    After=network.target # start after network service

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=root
    ExecStart=Your Commond

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target # runlevels

Software
--------
- Anaconda
- Matlab
- Chrome
- Shadowsocks
- Wechat

.. code:: shell

    sudo tlp-stat -b
    sudo tlp start
